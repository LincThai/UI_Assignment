Notes
I just was running out of time so some functionality was missed. They include the use of the navigation buttons in the skill tree for moving to skill types, locking and unlocking of skills and a change when you have learned a skill in both disabling the button and reducing the number of skill points.

I also was unable to test everything before handing it in so there may be some bugs.
